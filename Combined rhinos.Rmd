This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#outputs: a list called "kifaru" with rhinos, mortalities, sightings, patrols
library(tidyverse)
library("googlesheets4")
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

```
```{r}
comb_rhinos <- read.csv("~/Strathmore/MSc Data Science Analytics/Year 1/Module III/Dissertation Seminar I/Data folder/Combined rhino data.csv")
```

```{r}
#Generate a Cow Calf relationship
library(collapsibleTree)
library(data.tree)

# Create the rhinos_2 data frame
rhinos_2 <- data.frame(mother = comb_rhinos$Mother, child = comb_rhinos$Name)

# Add a root node
rhinos_2 <- rbind(data.frame(mother = "Root", child = unique(rhinos_2$mother)), rhinos_2)

#resolve for NAs

# Create a tree structure from the rhinos_2 data frame
rhino_tree <- FromDataFrameNetwork(rhinos_2)

# Generate a collapsible tree diagram
collapsibleTree(
  rhino_tree,
  root = "Root",
  nodeSize = "leafCount",
  fontSize = 10,
  linkLength = 50
)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
